# copies and unzips packaged python layers to your local python path
# Usage: Argument ($1) is optional. It will default to "python" as the pythong command,
#     which is the correct Python 3.x command for most modern systems.
#     If "python" in your setup still means Python 2.7, then you can supply the correct
#     Python 3.x command by passing it as the argument. 
#     For example, if the correct command is "python3", then trigger this script using:
#           ./install-layers-to-local.sh python3
